## Work Day Calendar-HW

Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

# Description

This is a basic day planner app that loops through the hours of 8am - 5pm(typical working hours) for a specific date, which is the current day that the user opens the app. The app uses moment.js to handle time. The app also allows the user to enter and save text into any description field that has a class of future. The data will be saved to the localStorage of the browser. The past hours are highlighted gray, the current hour red, and future hours green.
